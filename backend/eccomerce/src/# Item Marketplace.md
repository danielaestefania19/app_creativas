 # Item Marketplace

## Overview
This is a smart contract that implements an item marketplace where users can create, update, and remove items. The contract also allows users to vote on items, and the average rating of an item is calculated and stored.

## Prerequisites
To understand this code, you should have a basic understanding of Rust, Candid, and the Internet Computer.

## Code Explanation
### 1. Types and Constants
```rust
type Memory = VirtualMemory<DefaultMemoryImpl>;

const MAX_VALUE_SIZE_ITEM: u32 = 5000;
```
- `Memory` is an alias for the type of memory that will be used by the contract.
- `MAX_VALUE_SIZE_ITEM` is a constant that specifies the maximum size of an item in bytes.

### 2. Error Types
```rust
#[derive(CandidType, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, Hash, PartialEq)]
enum RatingError {
    Alreadyrated,
    InvalidValue,
    UpdateError,
}

#[derive(CandidType, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, Hash, PartialEq)]
enum ItemError {
    AlreadyExist,
    ItemNotAllowed,
    NotExist,
    Unauthorized,
    UpdateError,
    NoItemsAssociated,
    InvalidOwner,
    NoVotes,
    ItemNotFound,
    AlreadyVoted,

}

#[derive(CandidType, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, Hash, PartialEq)]
enum ItemSuccess {
    CreatedItem,
    UpdateItem,
}
```
- `RatingError` is an enum that defines the possible errors that can occur when rating an item.
- `ItemError` is an enum that defines the possible errors that can occur when creating, updating, or removing an item.
- `ItemSuccess` is an enum that defines the possible successful outcomes of creating or updating an item.

### 3. Rating
```rust
#[derive(CandidType, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, Hash, PartialEq)]
pub enum Rating {
    Zero,
    One,
    Two,
    Three,
    Four,
    Five,
}

impl Rating {
    pub fn value(&self) -> u8 {
        match self {
            Rating::Zero => 0,
            Rating::One => 1,
            Rating::Two => 2,
